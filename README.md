CodeFellows Assignment: Mailroom Madness.

This is a tool which tracks a list of donors based on the their contributions.
    -The user may send a thank you message to a current donor.
    -The user may enter a new donor.
    -The user may create a report of existing donors based on size and average contribution.

The user may select one of three intitial options: Send a Thank You, Get Report or Quit the Prompt
    -Selecting Thank you prompts for the entry of a donor name
        -the user may enter the new donor if not already present in list of donors
    -The prompt compiles donor information and responds with a 'Thank You' template for the selected donor
    -Selecting Create Report will iterate through a python dictionary and generate a report sorting the donors
    by size of their contributions and the average contribution.

It is implemented using command line prompt.
