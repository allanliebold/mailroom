CodeFellows Assignment: Mailroom Madness.

This is a tool which tracks a list of donars based on the their contributions.
    -The user may send a thank you message to a current donar.
    -The user may enter a new donar.
    -The user may create a report of existing donars based on size and average contribution.

The user may select one of three intitial options: Send a Thank You, Get Report or Quit the Prompt
    -Selecting Thank you prompts for the entry of a donar name
        -the user may enter the new donar if not already present in list of donars
    -The prompt compiles donar information and responds with a 'Thank You' template for the selected donar
    -Selecting Create Report will iterate through a python dictionary and generate a report sorting the donars
    by size of their contributions and the average contribution.

It is implemented using command line prompt.
